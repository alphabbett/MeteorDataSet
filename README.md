Meteor Camera Images and annotation labels taken from a stationary Sony IMX29 Meteor camera.
I collected this data to make a Meteor Camera, using a Yolov5 YOLO model and trained on real data.


Feel free to use, but please make sure I get credited.
I am using these cameras both with my own trained model and also with The Global Meteor Network's Software.
